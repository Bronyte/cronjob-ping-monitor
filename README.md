A lightweight Bash script that pings multiple hosts (Google, localhost, and user-defined IPs) on a schedule using `cron`.  
It logs results and sends email alerts if any target becomes unreachable.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- Pings Google DNS (`8.8.8.8`), and custom IPs.
- Logs results with timestamps into `/var/log/ping_check.log`.
- Sends email alerts if a host is unreachable.
- Fully automated with a cron job.

```bash
ALERT_EMAIL="your@email.com"

#Targets can be modified to need

TARGETS=(
  "8.8.8.8"          # Google DNS 
  "192.168.1.100"    # Custom IP 1
  "192.168.1.101"    # Custom IP 2
  "192.168.1.102"    # Custom IP 3
  # Add more Custom IP as needed
